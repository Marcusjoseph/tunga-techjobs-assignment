3. Write a shell script called `access_file.sh` which accepts one parameter and changes the permissions to `755`
4. Write a shell script called `unaccessible_sh.sh` which accepts one parameter and changes the permissions to `300`
5. Using `sed` write the command to replace all instances of the name "foo" with the string "bar" in a file called `baz.txt`
Write the command to only print out all of the `pids` using `awk`
Type in the `df -h`  command - it will show you much space you have on your hard drive. Using the `awk` command, print out only the first percentage capacity.
